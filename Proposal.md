The Data Science profession has seen phenomenal growth in recent years. As data collection and retrieval technologies improve, multiple industries ranging from healthcare to telecommunications have increased the sophistication of their data operations. Now, they are on the lookout for talent capable of processing the mountains of data to gain an edge over their competitors. With so many job opportunities opening up, one is bound to be confused about which role suits their career goals and skill set. 

As college graduates who aspire to be Data Scientists, we would like to understand the Data Science job market deeper than the superficial details provided by news articles and forecasts. Often job seekers apply for Data Science job roles based on information found from online sources and their professional networks. This might result in them losing out on their deserved pay or choosing a job location with a salary that doesn't match the cost of living for the city. We hope to solve this problem by building an interactive dashboard that can help a Data Science aspirant analyze the U.S. job market and discover roles matching their technical skillset, professional experience, and desired compensation.

## Proposed solution

For our final project, we would like to analyze data from well-known networking and job search portals such as LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor to get insights into the extent of data science hiring in the U.S. Our proposed interactive visualizations will help us answer questions like…

* Which states and cities have the most Data Science job openings ?

* Differences in salaries between Data Science, Data Engineer and Data analyst positions.

* Which industries and companies are actively hiring for data science roles in the U.S.?

* How do Data Science salaries vary with company size and industry ?

* How do Data Science Salaries compare across locations (cost of living wise) ?

* Which Industries/Companies offer the most lucrative Data Science jobs ?

* According to a company's job description, what are the recruiters looking for in a Data Science hire?

……and many more.

## Proposed Solution and Datasets

To build our interactive visualization, we will rely on the below datasets created by web scraping job listings from Glassdoor and Indeed. Our interactive visualizations on the above questions would help Data Science aspirants scout the U.S. job market and enable them to find the best job opportunities. We also plan to build a personalized job recommendation feature in our application that can analyze the user's skills, professional experience, location, and salary preferences and suggest roles satisfying their requirements. This application has the potential to guide Data Science aspirants towards applying fulfilling jobs and ensure a satisfying professional work experience.
