The Data Science profession has seen phenomenal growth in recent years. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics sees strong growth for data science job skills in its prediction that the field will grow about 28% through 2026. As technology improves, companies have been able to increase the sophistication of their data operations. Multiple industries ranging from healthcare to telecommunications are on the lookout for talent capable of processing the mountains of data at hand to gain an edge over their competitors.

As college graduates who aspire to be Data Scientists, we would like to understand the Data Science job market deeper than the superficial details provided by news articles and forecasts. For our final project, we would like to analyze data from some well-known networking and job search portals such as LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor to get insights into the extent of data science hiring in the U.S. Our proposed interactive visualizations will help us answer questions like…

* Which states and cities have the most number of Data Science job openings ?

* Differences in salaries between Data Science, Data Engineer and Data analyst positions.

* Which industries and companies are actively hiring for data science roles in the US ?

* How Data Science salaries vary with company size and industry ?

* How do Data Science Salaries compare across locations (cost of living wise) ?

* Which Industries/Companies offer the most lucrative Data Science jobs ?

* What are the recruiters looking for in a Data Science hire according to a company’s job description ?

……and many more.
